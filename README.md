# Eating-Balls-Game
A simple and fun game made with **HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT**

*Purpose of this game is to eat all of the balls(25) within the time given(20 sec.). Looks hard but do not worry! Every time you eat one, your ball is getting bigger so that you eat the others easier.*

Controls: W,A,S,D

This is MDN's assignment to those following the Javascript guide, and I made some improvements to boost my JS skills (e.g. Promise chaining, progress bar and some conditions.)
